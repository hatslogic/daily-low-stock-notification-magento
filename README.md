# daily-lowstock-notification-magento
This module will send daily notifications of low quantity products to the admin via email. Just uploading the folder to the root of magento will do the installation. After installing a field will appear in System > Config > Hatslogic area in the backend where you can manage the 'Quantity limit to send low inventory notification'.
